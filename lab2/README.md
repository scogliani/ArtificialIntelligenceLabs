# Search Strategies (Continuation)

This second lab assignment is the continuation of the first lab.
We will add new search strategies and draw a comparison of the different
implemented strategies

## Exercise 1 - Iterative deepening algorithm
Write a new version of the depth-first search using iterative deepening.
This can easy be made by adding a loop around the depth-first search
algorithm.

## Exercise 2 - Greedy best-first search

## Exercise 3 - A* search

## Exercise 4 - Comparing the search algorithms

### Delivrables

At the end of the lab session, you must hand in the **source code** containing
exercises as a tar file sent by email.
Before the next lab session, you must hand in a separate **report** with the
answers to the question of the exercise 4
